Everything in this docs has been written by me :)

## Getting Started
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Typography
- For google_fonts we can disable online fetch by downloading the fonts and adding them to the project


## Notes
- Make the logout as far as possible from the other buttons and hardest to access by mistake.


## Add new icon
Using icon_font_generator package allows us to add new icons to the project easily as fonts (same as flutter icons).
- Add the icon to the icons folder in the project main dir ../icons
- Run the following command on Mac or Linux
```bash
chmod +x ./generate_icon.sh
./generate_icon.sh
```


# implementations

# Packages


# Deeplink (Universal links)
